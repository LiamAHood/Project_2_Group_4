## Questions to Answer
1. Which hashtags have the longest/shortest average tweet length? 
2. Which hashtags are largely associated with positive/negative/neutral tweets? 
4. Which hashtags are seen the most with other hashtags? (i.e. tweets with more than one hashtag)
5. Which hashtag is used the most by popular accounts and how does that compare to normal accounts?
6. In what language are most tweets relating to specific topics?

9. How many times did #{hashtag} get mentioned in a tweet on {day}? (#WednesdayWisdom, #TBT, #FridayFeeling, #Caturday, #SundayFunday)

## To-DO
1. Finalize queries - Push to Github from GoogleDocs
2. Execture queries and analyze
3. Create slides for the presentation (Google Slides?)
4. Practice Presentation (Ideally before the weekend)

## Technologies
- Apache Spark
- Spark SQL
- YARN
- HDFS and/or S3
- Scala 2.12.10
- Git + GitHub

## Notes for anyone running code 
- Jar files are in their own folder (seperate for each person or question)
- Be careful running context search as it will take 45 minutes to run (to avoid hitting rate limits)
- context search also uses up ~75,000 tweet searches so be careful of that as well
- Analysis for most of the questions is easier to examine by opening the projects, commenting out the search functions, and relying on saved results of past searches
